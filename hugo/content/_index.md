  secure:
    title: Secure your API
    content: "![Security](images/yellow-lock-icon.png) Whitelist your GraphQL operations, restrict dynamic queries, apply role or attribute based security rules, restrict access at the operation or field level, filter/sort responses based on the role of the authenticated user. Plugs into any authentication system via simple hooks. Support for rate-limiting, API key maangement, and usage based billing."
  performance:
    title: Improve Performance
    content: "![Cloudflare Workers](images/performance.svg) API Mate runs on Cloudflare Workers and scales instantly across 200+ cities around the world. Get lower latency for your API with faster TCP and TLS handshakes. Configure edge caching per query or field to cache responses nearer to your users. Support Apollo automatic persisted queries to shrink request size." 
  simple:
    title: Make the simple easy, and the hard possible
    content: 
  injection:
    title: REST to GraphQL
    content: "![GraphQL](images/graphql.svg) Convert your REST APIs to GraphQL at the edge, execute and combine multiple REST requests in parallel. Generate your GraphQL schema from REST results / GraphQL queries. Use our fetch API as a GraphQL curl to do simple integrations with zero code."
  audit:  
    title: Logging and metrics
    content: "![Audit Logs](images/audit.svg) Encrypted logs of the full request/response, setup alerts for errors, graph request and latency by operation. Include information on the logged in user to
    have full audit-trails for your API. Recover from data-loss bugs where request data was unintentionally discarded or destructively transformed - something your current backups don't protect you against."
